# romlauncher

Project in early development to be used for any Linux distro in conjunction with Lutris.
<br>
Contains empty pga.db that is modified from Lutris's original db file in that it contains a few additional columns
<br>
Project doesn't yet support additional commandline arguments without modifying the source files and still requires Lutris to be installed in your system
<br>
lutris_bulk_adder2.py is a heavily modified version of the source file in the below link.  You will need to follow its install instructions then cut and paste the contents of lutris_bulk_adder2.py to its install file
