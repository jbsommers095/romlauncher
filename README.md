# romlauncher

Project in early development to be used for any Linux distro in conjunction with Lutris.

Contains empty pga.db that is modified from Lutris's original db file in that it contains a few additional columns

Project doesn't yet support additional commandline arguments without modifying the source files and still requires Lutris to be installed in your system
